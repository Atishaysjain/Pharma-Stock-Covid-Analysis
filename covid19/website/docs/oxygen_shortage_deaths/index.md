We are recording‌ ‌deaths‌ ‌due‌ ‌to‌ ‌the‌ ‌lack‌ ‌of oxygen, shortage of oxygen, or denial of ‌oxygen‌ ‌in‌ ‌hospitals‌ ‌during‌ ‌the‌ ‌second‌ ‌wave‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌Covid-19‌ ‌pandemic‌ ‌in‌ ‌India‌.

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #3b8dbd; font-weight: bold;">2.Why‌ ‌are‌ you ‌doing‌ ‌this?‌ ‌</summary>
We see this as part of a democratic effort, to maintain an archive‌ ‌of‌ ‌lives‌ ‌lost‌ ‌due‌ ‌to‌ ‌lack‌ ‌of‌ ‌oxygen‌. We are maintaining‌ ‌a‌ ‌record‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌human‌ ‌costs‌ ‌of‌ ‌the‌ ‌institutional‌ ‌crises‌ ‌that‌ ‌have‌ ‌led‌ ‌to‌ oxygen‌ ‌shortages‌. This will also help in countering‌ ‌the‌ ‌ongoing‌ ‌denial‌ ‌and‌ ‌erasure‌ ‌of‌ ‌these‌ ‌deaths‌ ‌in official and government narratives. We hope that this documentation will provide lessons, now and in the future.

We started ‌recording‌ ‌cases‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌first‌ ‌week‌ ‌of‌ ‌May‌. The‌ ‌earliest‌ ‌report‌ ‌we‌ ‌have‌ ‌is‌ ‌from 13 April 2021.

<summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #3b8dbd; font-weight: bold;">4.Who‌ ‌are‌ you?‌ </summary>
We‌ ‌are‌ ‌an‌ ‌independent‌ ‌group‌ ‌of‌ ‌volunteers,‌ ‌researchers,‌ lawyers, ‌journalists,‌ ‌students,‌ ‌and‌ ‌activists.‌

<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #3b8dbd; font-weight: bold;">5.What‌ ‌are‌ ‌the‌ ‌limitations of this exercise?‌</summary>
Our‌ ‌effort‌ ‌will‌ ‌underestimate‌ ‌the‌ ‌actual‌ ‌number‌ ‌of‌ ‌deaths,‌ ‌since‌ ‌we‌ ‌are‌ ‌relying‌ ‌on‌ ‌verified,‌ ‌publicly‌ ‌available‌ ‌information,‌ ‌which‌ ‌is‌ ‌likely‌ ‌to‌ ‌miss‌ ‌many‌ ‌deaths‌ ‌that‌ ‌go‌ ‌unreported‌. In general, deaths due to lack of other resources are missed. Since we are focusing on deaths within hospitals, those that were unable to be admitted in the hospitals will be missed. This is much more likely in rural areas, where healthcare access remains severely constrained.

<summary style="cursor: pointer; color: #3b8dbd; font-weight: bold;">10. How are you verifying details of deaths and incidents? </summary>
When multiple reports referring to the same incident cite different death counts, we usually record the lowest number, and note this discrepancy in the comments. In some incidents of conflicting reports, we have had access to a more reliable estimate, such as the estimate cited in court documents. This is the death count we have used in our database in such cases. In cases where government agencies or hospital authorities have denied that deaths  were because of oxygen denial, we have relied on multiple media reports to assess facts. In cases where a committee has been set up by the government to assess the cause of deaths, we have also relied on multiple reports. We will update our database when results from the committee reports are available. In cases where only one media report is available, we do not immediately add the deaths to our database.
