We are planning to do weekly consolidated releases 10. How are you verifying details of deaths and incidents? When multiple reports referring to the same incident cite different death counts, we usually record the lowest number, and note this discrepancy in the comments. In some incidents of conflicting reports, we have had access to a more reliable estimate, such as the estimate cited in court documents. This is the death count we have used in our database in such cases. In cases where government agencies or hospital authorities have denied that deaths were because of oxygen denial, we have relied on multiple media reports to assess facts. In cases where a committee has been set up by the government to assess the cause of deaths, we have also relied on multiple reports. We will update our database when results from the committee reports are available. In cases where only one media report is available, we do not immediately add the deaths to our database.
